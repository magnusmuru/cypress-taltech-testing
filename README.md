# Cypress assignment

Acceptance testing TalTech [homepage](https://taltech.ee/).

## How to run:

1) Clone repo into a new folder. 
2) Open a terminal in the root folder, by default it should be `assignment-cypress` or whatever custom folder you cloned it in.
3) Type `npx cypress open`. This will also do `npm install` so you don't have to do it first.
4) Find and click the tests in the Cypress GUI, they are under `taltech.spec.js`.

**NOTE:** On first run due to the large amount of files the site uses, the first two or three tests will time out. This is normal. Just re-run and they will be fine.
